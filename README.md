# Quality Inspection Project ReadMe

This repository contains the work and documentation for a Quality Inspection Project developed as part of the IENG 493C module. The project aims to automate defect detection in cell phone manufacturing using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, adhering to the CRISP-DM framework. Below are the details and instructions for the project.

---

## Project Overview

The project addresses a critical issue in the CP-Lab manufacturing process: the lack of a quality inspection system for detecting defects in cell phone main cases. To solve this, a hands-free, non-invasive image-based inspection system was designed and implemented. This system uses an overhead camera to capture images of parts on a conveyor belt and employs ML/DL models for defect classification.

## Features

- **Defect Detection**: Detects visible defects such as scratches and excess material on parts.
- **Automated Inspection**: Hands-free, image-based inspection using machine learning.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes noise addition and feature standardization for improved model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity.
- **Integration Ready**: Designed for seamless deployment in manufacturing environments.

## CRISP-DM Workflow

1. **Business Understanding**:
   - Addressed the lack of inspection processes in CP-Lab by proposing an automated ML-based solution.
   - Designed an overhead camera setup for non-invasive defect detection.

2. **Data Understanding**:
   - Dataset contains images of good and defective parts divided into separate folders.
   - Explored dataset quality, diversity, and image resolution.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Preprocessed images by cropping, labeling, and normalizing pixel values.
   - Augmented data to increase the dataset size and diversity.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Trained and tested multiple ML models (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) and a deep learning model.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using confusion matrices and derived metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
   - Identified deep learning as the optimal solution based on performance consistency.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Provided deployment plans for engineering teams, corporate leaders, and shop-floor employees.
